  "project-dragonfly": "Dragonfly",
  "project-dragonfly-intro": "In popular culture, dragonflies are known for preying on mosquito larvae that transmit arboviruses. Inspired by this concept, Dragonfly GeoAnalytics is a platform developed to help municipalities combat arboviruses by mapping outbreak sites and disease cases through aerial images captured by drones. This allows for real-time monitoring of statistics and analysis on the progression of these diseases.",
  "project-dragonfly-dev": "Dragonfly was developed as an ecosystem: it features a React frontend, two backends—one for data provision using Express.js and another for OAuth authentication using Django REST Framework—along with additional components like a pg_tileserv server and a PostGIS database to provide tiles in MVT format.",
  "project-dragonfly-frontend": "On the frontend, I utilized the react-map-gl library for rendering maps with Mapbox and the Highcharts library for chart rendering. UI components were handled by Chakra UI, and the entire interface was designed in dark mode to give the system a modern look.",
  "project-dragonfly-backend": "For the backend, I chose the combination of Express.js and Prisma to implement a data API with strong typing and rapid development speed. For the authentication management API, I used Django REST Framework along with Django OAuth Toolkit to accelerate the deployment of a cutting-edge user authentication system.",

  "project-geoserver-title": "Geoserver Mobile Client",
  "project-geoserver-intro": "The Geoserver Mobile Client is an application developed in Ionic, React, TypeScript, and OpenLayers that serves as a mobile client for Geoserver. The idea arose to meet the needs of users who already use a web system to manage geographic layers but required a mobile solution to download data, view it offline, access layers, edit features, and add new information directly from the device.",
  "project-geoserver-dev": "The choice of technologies, such as Ionic and React, was motivated by their flexibility and the vast ecosystem of mapping tools offered by OpenLayers, allowing for efficient rendering of vector and raster layers, as well as support for drawing complex features.",
  "project-geoserver-frontend": "The frontend was developed using Ionic and React, with OpenLayers for managing geographic data and rendering maps. The interfaces were built responsively, enabling intuitive and efficient navigation on mobile devices.",
  "project-geoserver-backend": "Geoserver was the only backend used in the project, leveraging its REST APIs to manage workspaces, stores, layers, users, and styles, eliminating the need for additional backend development.",
  "project-geoserver-mobile": "The app was developed for mobile devices with full support for offline interaction, allowing users to download data, access geographic layers, and edit features directly in the app.",
  "project-geoserver-contract": "This project was developed within the company I work for and took 3 weeks to complete, from requirements gathering to publishing the app on Google Play.",
  "project-geoserver-deployment": "The app was published via Ionic Appflow, with a non-listed distribution on Google Play, accessible only to authorized users by the client.",
  "project-geoserver-description": "This mobile client for Geoserver allows users to access geographic layers on their mobile device, supporting offline feature downloads, field data collection, and export in GeoJSON format.",
  "skyforest-title": "Automating Geospatial Data Processing and Delivery for Skyforest",
  "skyforest-intro": "Skyforest needed an efficient way to process and distribute large volumes of drone imagery and forestry data through GeoServer. The manual workflow required mosaicking images, generating pyramids, configuring GeoServer, managing users, and delivering credentials to clients.",
  "skyforest-solution": "To streamline this process, I developed an event-driven system in Node.js that automated the entire pipeline. A monitoring service, integrated with Redis, detected file changes by comparing hashes, ensuring only new or modified data was processed. GDAL pipelines handled compression and pyramid generation, optimizing files for web delivery. GeoServer configurations, including workspaces, stores, layers, and user permissions, were created dynamically. A queueing mechanism in Redis managed processing tasks efficiently, preventing memory overloads.",
  "skyforest-interface": "To enhance client experience, I built a web interface where users could log in, access their data, and retrieve documentation without needing technical support.",
  "skyforest-impact": "The system significantly reduced manual effort, improved performance by optimizing data processing, and scaled efficiently as data volumes grew. Skyforest's clients gained direct access to their datasets with minimal friction.",
  "skyforest-conclusion": "This project allowed me to bridge frontend and backend development, integrating GDAL pipelines, Redis-based automation, and GeoServer configuration into a seamless data delivery system.",
  "skyforest-technologies": "Technologies used: Node.js, Redis, GDAL, GeoServer, and a Linux-based geospatial server.",

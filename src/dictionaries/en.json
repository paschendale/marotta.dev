  "home-text-1": "I'm a full stack developer specializing in geotechnologies. I have extensive experience with major frontend development tools like React, Angular, TypeScript, and Next.js. I'm also proficient in map libraries such as Mapbox, OpenLayers, and Leaflet, and have worked with a variety of backend frameworks including Spring, Play Framework, Django, Express.js, and Nest.js.",
  "home-text-2": "I graduated with a degree in Surveying and Cartographic Engineering in Universidade Federal de Viçosa, hold a Master's degree in Civil Engineering with a focus on Spatial Information, and I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering, also focusing on Spatial Information.",
  "home-text-3": "Right now, I'm working as a requirements analyst at a cartographic engineering company in Brazil, but I'm open to freelancing opportunities both in Brazil and abroad.",

  "project-dragonfly-intro": "In popular culture, dragonflies are known for preying on mosquito larvae that transmit arboviruses. Inspired by this concept, Dragonfly GeoAnalytics is a platform developed to help municipalities combat arboviruses by mapping outbreak sites and disease cases through aerial images captured by drones. This allows for real-time monitoring of statistics and analysis on the progression of these diseases.",
  "project-dragonfly-dev": "Dragonfly was developed as an ecosystem: it features a React frontend, two backends—one for data provision using Express.js and another for OAuth authentication using Django REST Framework—along with additional components like a pg_tileserv server and a PostGIS database to provide tiles in MVT format.",
  "project-dragonfly-frontend": "On the frontend, I utilized the react-map-gl library for rendering maps with Mapbox and the Highcharts library for chart rendering. UI components were handled by Chakra UI, and the entire interface was designed in dark mode to give the system a modern look.",
  "project-dragonfly-backend": "For the backend, I chose the combination of Express.js and Prisma to implement a data API with strong typing and rapid development speed. For the authentication management API, I used Django REST Framework along with Django OAuth Toolkit to accelerate the deployment of a cutting-edge user authentication system.",
  "project-dragonfly-mobile": "Dragonfly GeoAnalytics also includes a mobile module, developed as a separate project.",
  "project-dragonfly-contract": "In this project, I was contracted by a Brazilian engineering company to develop all aspects related to the platform: the design, development, methodology for data collection, and cloud deployment.",
  "project-dragonfly-deployment": "Currently, the platform is deployed for various municipalities with a GitOps pipeline across the entire ecosystem, updating applications and infrastructure using the concept of Infrastructure as Code. All applications are containerized and deployed in Docker Swarm with Portainer."
